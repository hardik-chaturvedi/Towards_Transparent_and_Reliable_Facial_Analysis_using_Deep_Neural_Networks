# EfficientNet-FaceRecognition-with-Explainability-and-Robustness
This project implements a face recognition system using transfer learning with EfficientNet, designed to be both robust to noise and explainable. It demonstrates how modern deep learning models can handle degraded input while still offering transparency in decision-making.
